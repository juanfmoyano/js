/*
	[3. WeakMap]
	- WeakMap is a collection of key/value pairs in which the keys are weakly referenced.
	- The keys must be objects and the values can be arbitrary values.
	- The keys of WeakMap are weakly referenced, which means that they can be garbage collected if there are no other references to them.
	- WeakMap is not iterable, so there is no method to get all keys or values.
	- WeakMap has the following methods:
		- set(key, value): Adds a new key/value pair to the WeakMap.
		- get(key): Returns the value associated with the key.
		- has(key): Returns true if the key exists in the WeakMap, otherwise false.
		- delete(key): Removes the key/value pair from the WeakMap.
		- clear(): Removes all key/value pairs from the WeakMap.
	- WeakMap is useful for storing private data associated with an object. 

	Use case: private data
	If we're working with an object that "belongs" to another code (even third-party libraries), and we want to store some data on it, we can use WeakMap to store the private data. 
	This way, we can ensure that the private data is not accessible from outside the object and it should only exists while the object is alive.

	Use case: caching
	WeakMap can be used for caching data that is associated with an object.

// Use case: caching
// With Map -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// üìÅ cache.js
let cache = new Map();

// calculate and remember the result
function process(obj) {
  if (!cache.has(obj)) {
    let result = /* calculations of the result for */ obj;

    cache.set(obj, result);

// Now we use process() in another file:

// üìÅ main.js
let obj = {
  /* let's say we have an object */
};

let result1 = process(obj); // calculated

// ...later, from another place of the code...
let result2 = process(obj); // remembered result taken from cache

// ...later, when the object is not needed any more:
obj = null;

console.log(cache.size); // 1 (Ouch! The object is still in cache, taking memory!)

// With WeakMap -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// üìÅ cache.js
let cache2 = new WeakMap();

// calculate and remember the result
function process(obj) {
  if (!cache2.has(obj)) {
    let result = /* calculate the result for */ obj;

    cache2.set(obj, result);
    return result;
  }

  return cache2.get(obj);
}

// üìÅ main.js
let obj2 = {
  /* some object */
};

let result3 = process(obj2);
let result4 = process(obj2);

// ...later, when the object is not needed any more:
obj2 = null;

// Can't get cache.size, as it's a WeakMap,
// but it's 0 or soon be 0
// When obj gets garbage collected, cached data will be removed as well
